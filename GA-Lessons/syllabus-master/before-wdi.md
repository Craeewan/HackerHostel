### Important!

**Please complete the following steps as soon as possible.** We can't make classroom/squad assignments until you do!

3. **Update your GitHub profile with your full name and profile picture.** The latter is very important - we need to know what you look like! The clearer the picture, the better.

4. **Sign Up for our private Github server account**
  - [Sign Up here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/join?source=header)
  This account is completely separate from your personal github account. It exists only in our private Github server. All work related to the course will live in this organization.

Once you're done, we encourage you to take a look through [this README](readme.md) if you would like to learn more about what you can expect out of WDI.

See you all at orientation!
