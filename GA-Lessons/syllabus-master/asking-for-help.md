# Asking For Help

## During Normal Weeks

You can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. Slack is the most effective way to communicate with instructors.

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions...

1. Try something else
2. Google your exact problem or error
3. Reference the appropriate lesson plan
4. Ask another classmate
5. Ask an instructor

If your question is **non-technical** -- you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- please reach out directly to an instructor as soon as possible.

**After 5pm**, the point of contact will be your TA. Instructors may not be able to respond to technical questions until the following morning.

## During Project Time

GitHub issues are the **ONLY** method for answering technical questions. 90% of the time, at least one instructor will be dedicated to monitoring issues at all times during business hours. The other 10% will be announced in advance on Slack.


#### Asking For Help
As projects are mostly self-driven, we expect you to spend a lot of time debugging errors and problem solving on your own. However, if you hit a roadblock for more than an hour, please seek our help by following the steps below:
  1. Create a Github issue (**ON YOUR PROJECT's REPO**) with the following:
    * Be able to accurately describe your issue
    * Identify the code snippet that is giving you an issue
    * Tell us 3 things that you tried in order to solve the issue
    * _If_ there is an error message, tell us what that error message means
    * tag **all** instructors on the issue
  1. Following _**ALL**_ of the correct steps will result in either of the following:
    * A scheduled appointment with an instructor
    * A response in your issue - this will be used if there is a simple fix. If there isn't, this will result in an appointment with an instructor as well
  3. *Please close your issues when you've successfully solved them*, and let us know what the solution was!

**Note:**
- **We'll close issues that do not conform to this guidelines**.
- Issues can only be reopened by instructors. Therefore, should your issue get closed, please create a *new* issue, and if it's applicable to your previous issue, just include a link to the previous issue.

#### Why Issues?

Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

#### FAQ

> During project week, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?

You should not. An instructor will promptly reach out to you if you have followed the above steps correctly. We will support you 100% of the way, but you need to follow the correct procedures to maximize your learning experience and the time of the instructional team.
