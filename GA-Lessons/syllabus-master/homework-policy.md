# Homework

- Homework will take more time for some, and less time for others. It is up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise.

- Turn in **something**. Turning in an incomplete assignment is **infinitely** better than turning in nothing at all. We can't get you the help you need unless we see what you're working on. That said...

- **Late homework will not be accepted**. If you have issues submitting homework please let us know.

## Due Dates and Grading

- You will generally be assigned homework every day.

- Unless otherwise directed, each assignment should be forked and cloned to your computer from the link given to you by your instructional team.

- It must be submitted as an issue in the original assignment's repo. You must
provide a link to your completed assessment's repository in the issue.

- Homework is graded only on **meaningful progress**. That is: that you made an effort to complete it, regardless of whether you were successful. The criteria is subject to change based on the assignment, but it will be provided to you as part of it.

- Plagiarized homework will **NOT** be accepted. Furthermore, **it is grounds for expulsion from the program**. Read more [here - GA Plagiarism Policy](ga-plagiarism-policy.md).

- **We rely on homework to know where you're at.** It's very much to your advantage to turn in your homework the day it's assigned, even if -- *especially* if -- you're not able to finish it. Then we can address concerns before the unit continues and help you not to fall behind.

- Feedback will be given by your squad leader once a week. The feedback could be on any homework or assignment for the week.

## What to include with your submission

On **every submission** please include:
- **Comfort score**, out of 5
- **Completeness score**, out of 5
- **Wins**, a sentence or two about what went great!
- **Challenges**, a sentence or two about what challenged you the most.

## The Submission Process

All homework/assignments will have their own Github repository, under our organization `https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-1-30`.

1. Please **fork** new assignments/homework.
2. Then, **clone** your fork to your computer.
3. Complete your work inside it.
4. Then, **push** your completed work to your forked repository.
5. Create an issue in the assignment's original repo. You must include a link to your forked repo.
