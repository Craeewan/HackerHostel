# Attendance

## Policy

In a nutshell:
- 4 _unexcused_ absences = ** Will not get a letter of completion**

Examples of _excused_ absences:
- absences due to medical emergencies. (We reserve the right to ask for a doctor's note)
- absences due to religious observance.

Examples of _unexcused_ absences:
- Any absences not previously communicated [and approved] in advance to [by] the instructional team.

For more details in how attendance fits in your Graduation Requirements, please check [graduation requirements - attendance](graduation-requirements.md#attendance)!

#### When do we take attendance?

If today begins at 9:00AM, then any attendance taken at 9:01 will be considered "tardy". Attendance cannot be taken three hours after the start time. That is: if you try to take attendance at 12:01, you will be considered "absent".

**There are no exceptions**

## Delays

Of course, Metro delays can happen. The solution is to leave every day earlier than you think you should. The instructors are on-time every day and we live all over the area. **If the instructors can do it, so can you!**

Coming in late is a huge distraction to the instructors and students. It shows a lack of commitment to the program as well as a lack of respect to your peers and instructors. It is also a bad habit that will hinder your ability to learn and grow, both as a student and as a professional.
