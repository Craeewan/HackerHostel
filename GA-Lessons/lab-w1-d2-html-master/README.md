# Responsive design Lab - _(60m)_

## Introduction
Hello my dear developer! You have been tasked with a front-end dev code challenge. Yay!
You have been given starter code. Fork the following repo: `https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-1-30/lab-w1-d2-html`.
Clone your fork in your computer's working directory.

## Exercise

#### Phase 1
- Update the `styles.css`. Add properties to the rules already defined in the stylesheet. NOTE: You **can** define different rules or remove the ones included in the file.
- Phase 1 must look like this:

#### Phase 2
- You must find the correct break point (pixels) where to include a media query. As it is now, when you make the browser's screen smaller than X pixels, the pictures bleed outside of the container. Use media queries to fix this behavior.
- At this breakpoint, the list is now centered. It is no longer on the left side.
- Phase 2 must look like this:

### BONUS
- Implement your own grid system like we saw in class.
- Include 4 more shows of your preference and display all shows as a 3x3 grid.
- NOTE: This bonus is designed to be very hard. **Make sure you have completed the basic requirements before attempting the bonus**

## Requirements
- Follow the AirBnb CSS Styleguide, [here](https://github.com/airbnb/css)
- The final version should be up to **Phase 2** standards.

## Deliverable
- Add, commit, and push all changes to your github repo.
- Take 2 screenshot of your final site.
  - One at full screen.
  - One where the media query has changed the layout.
